I'm studying to take the CKA exam soon.  A few of the things I've done to prepare: 

- Setup and configured my Raspberry Pi [Dramble](https://devinflake.com/)
- Completed Nana Janashia's [Ultimate Kubernetes Administrator Course](https://techworld-with-nana.teachable.com/p/the-complete-kubernetes-course)
- Watched and attended many, many [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/) lectures and videos by Sander van Vugt
- Completed [Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)

Things I need to do:

- Take the practice tests at [killer.sh](https://killer.sh)
- Actually schedule the exam!

I hope to take the exam in the next week or two.  Wish me luck!
